# Vagrant remove old box versions plugin

This plugin enables you to automatically remove old vagrant boxes from you host. Just run ``vagrant remove-old-versions`` and it will check your downloaded boxes and remove every box that is not the lastest downloaded version.

Internally it uses ```vagrant box list``` to get a list of boxes, and ```vagrant box remove --box-version  xxx --provider xxx``` so it still has all safeguards you expect from vagrant.
